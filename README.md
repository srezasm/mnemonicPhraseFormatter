# nmonicPhraseFormatter
For each indivisual nmonic words in the bip39, there is a unique starter substring.   

For example:
* abandon => aba
* arrive => arriv
* cave => cav
* era => era

So the base idia is to split the unique part out of each nmonic word and stick them after one another by the default order and remake the original nmonic phrase as the same way later on.

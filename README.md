# Mnemonic Phrase Formatter

For each individual mnemonic words in the bip39, there is a unique starter substring.

For example:

* abandon => aba
* arrive => arriv
* cave => cav
* era => era

So the base idea is to split the unique part out of each mnemonic word and stick them after one another by the default order and remake the original mnemonic phrase as the same way later on.

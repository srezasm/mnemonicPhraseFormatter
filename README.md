# Mnemonic Phrase Formatter

For each individual mnemonic word in the bip39 words list, there is a unique starter substring.

For example:

* abandon => aba
* arrive => arriv
* cave => cav
* era => era

So the base idea is to split the unique part out of each mnemonic word and stick them after one another order to generate a digest-unreadable phrase or remake the original mnemonic phrase later on as the same way.
